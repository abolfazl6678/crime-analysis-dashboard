# crime-analysis-dashboard (Tableau)
Tableau project analyzing crime data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Includes interactive dashboards for law enforcement decision-making and public communication.



# 🕵️ Crime Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview  
Crime analysis plays a vital role in supporting law enforcement agencies by identifying crime patterns and enabling data-driven decision-making. This project focuses on building **interactive Tableau dashboards** to analyze crime statistics, detect trends, and provide actionable insights for the police department.  

The dashboards help in:  
- Monitoring crime hotspots  
- Understanding temporal crime patterns  
- Studying arrest vs. non-arrest incidents  
- Supporting preventive strategies for crime reduction

## 🎯 Problem Objective  
As a data scientist, the goal was to:  
- **Prepare a dashboard/story in Tableau** to keep the police department and city updated on crime statistics.  
- **Enable data storytelling** by presenting clear, interactive, and insightful visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset & Variables  
The dataset was provided through the course LMS and includes detailed crime records.  

**Key Variables:**  
- **ID** – Unique identifier for each record  
- **Case Number** – Police department’s unique case ID  
- **Date** – Date of incident occurrence  
- **Block** – Partially redacted address of incident  
- **UCR Code** – Uniform Crime Reporting code  
- **Primary Type & Description** – Classification of crime  
- **Location Description** – Place where incident occurred  
- **Arrest / Domestic** – Whether arrest was made / domestic in nature  
- **Beat / District / Ward / Community Area** – Police & geographic identifiers  
- **NIC Code** – National Incident Code classification  
- **Coordinates / Latitude / Longitude** – Geo-spatial details  
- **Year / Updated On** – Timeline attributes

## 🛠️ Steps & Dashboards Created  

### 1️⃣ Overall Crime Statistics Dashboard  
- Displayed **total count and types of crimes** reported.  
- Highlighted **crime locations on a geo-map** (hotspots).  
- Added **live crime feed**: total crimes reported in the current year + most recent crime (time & location).  

### 2️⃣ Time Period Analysis Dashboard  
- Distribution of crime incidents by **day of the week** and **hour of the day**.  
- Percentage of crimes by **time blocks** (e.g., early morning, afternoon, evening).  

### 3️⃣ Trend Analysis Dashboard  
- Studied changes in **crime rate across years**.  
- Compared **incident reporting trends** for the same date/time across years.  

### 4️⃣ Comparative Analysis Dashboard  
- Analyzed incidents with **arrest vs. no arrest**.  
- Percentage of **domestic-related incidents** by crime category.  

### 5️⃣ Interactivity  
- Added **filters** for incident type and location for granular exploration.
